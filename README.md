# Datasets
- The dataset came from esa sentinel 2 dataset
## knowing the dataset
- here is the dataset configuration

# What I Doing
- exploring on Sentinel2A dataset where this dataset is already been preprocessed, such as atmospheric corection, geometric corecction, and radiometric correction.
- Others dataset prepocesed, like converting JP2 image from Sentinel dataset to TiFF
- Getting NDVI value from the TIFF File
- Masking / Croping the Tiff file Using GeoJson File

# Now Problems
- How to train LULC
- What is the Input and Output

# Research
- Vegetation Index
- Segmentation Algorithm

# Note
